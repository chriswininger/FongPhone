Fong Tron
==============

The fong tron is a special multi user fork of the fongphone that lives in this branch

To run it you just need to do `Port=3000 Interaction_Timeout=50000 node ./server/galleryServer.js`

Now connect a browser to localhost:3000/display.html

in another browser sessions with mobile simulation turned on visit localhost:3000 (the simulation is required for touch events)

here's a helpful video I made for myself
